## Password Generator

A simple basic password generator that is able to create a random character generator using the random module in a 10 length format

## WIP

Needs the addition of uppercase and lower case letters
and the number of characters so separate into different values/.

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
